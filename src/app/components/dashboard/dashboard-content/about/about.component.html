            Hello! My name is <b>Sia Chee Zhen</b> and I love learning new technologies. I have completed
            my <b>Diploma in Information & Communication with specialism in Software Engineering (2021)</b>
            and I have worked as an <b>Web Developer</b> at 
            <a href="https://qubeapps.com/" target="_blank" class="link">
                Qube Apps Solutions R&D
            </a> 
            for three months during my internship. I am currently pursuing a <b>Degree in Computer 
            Science with specialism in Intelligent Systems</b> at Asia Pacific University and is 
            currently in the 2nd year.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            My interest in studying both web development and computer science started back in 2017, during
            my high school days when I was exposed to seminars related to information and technology. From
            then on, it sparked my interests as I started exploring the web development field by learning
            <b>web development languages, such as HTML, CSS and JS (which also includes back-end languages,
                such as PHP and MySQL)</b> by reading articles and watching videos related to the topics online.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Besides that, I am into all kinds of <b>software development</b> that require creativeness and patience,
            especially <b>web development and tinkering with machine-learning algorithms</b>. In my free time, I
            usually watch anime, play games or watch documentary vide os related to both military logistics and
            also interesting css tricks.
        </p>
        <br>
        Here are some <b>technologies/ languages/ framework</b> that I am learning and working with:
        <ul class="language-list">
            <b>
                <li>Python</li>
                <li>R</li>
                <li>LabView</li>
                <li>Java</li>
                <li>HTML, CSS, JS</li>
